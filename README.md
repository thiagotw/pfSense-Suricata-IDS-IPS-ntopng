# pfSense & Suricata IDS/IPS Lab
I built this lab to gain practical experience configuring and managing a firewall and IDS/IPS, specifically to understand how network threats are detected, logged, and prevented in real time. I began by experimenting with firewall rules in pfSense to understand how traffic is allowed or denied. Once I was comfortable with that, I moved on to configuring alerts and blocking suspicious traffic using Suricata. My goal was to become comfortable navigating alert logs, tuning rule sets, and simulating real-world traffic to better understand how to monitor and respond to potential intrusions. 

## Tools & Technologies Used

- VirtualBox (Home Lab Environment)
  - Ubuntu (24.04.2)
  - Kali-linux
-Wireshark
- pfSense (Firewall)
- Suricata (IDS/IPS)
  - Emerging Threats Rule Set

## What This Lab Does
- Sets up pfSense as the primary firewall and router within a virtual or physical home lab environment.
- Installs and configures Suricata to monitor traffic on the WAN and LAN interface.
- Enables IDS and IPS modes to detect and automatically block suspicious or malicious activity.
- Integrates Emerging Threats rule set to detect common attacks.
- Captures, logs, and displays real-time alerts through the pfSense GUI.

## Screenshots (before Suricata, just using pfSense)

#### Using Kali to flood the target with hping3:

#### Wireshark showing hping3 traffic:

#### Created new pfSense rule to block TCP traffic from Kali:

#### "Block Kali DoS" rule successfully blocks the hping3 traffic:

## Screenshots (Now, using Suricata)
After setting up my Suricata IDS, alerts can be seen now.

#### Suricata alerts for hping3 traffic:

#### Suricata alerts for nmap scan:

Then, I configured my Suricata IPS to block malicious activity.

## Lessons Learned
Throughout this experience, I learned many things. I learned how to build and manage firewall rules, monitor traffic, and how to configure intrusion detection and prevention systems. This helped me understand how security teams use these tools to protect networks against real-world threats. I also became more confident using tools like Suricata, pfSense, and Wireshark.
